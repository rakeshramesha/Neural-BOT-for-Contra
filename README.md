# Neural-BOT-for-Contra
### Genetically Evolved Neural Game BOT for Konami's Contra game

Contra is a video Game developed by Konami in 1987. Its a classic Arcade game which is very popular even today.

Contra is a tricky game to develop good BOTS because the game involves a lot of actions like  running, jumping, evading, power-ups, shooting, and very tricky boss stages. It was one of the first games of the time to have a variety of game play views.
